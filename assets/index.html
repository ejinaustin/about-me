      <p>
        I work at the intersection of creativity, problem-solving, and
        practicality — helping ideas become things that actually work in
        the real world.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background spans operations, design, and technical systems.
        That usually means I’m translating between people who think very
        differently and helping them land on solutions that make sense
        for everyone involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care about clarity, good process, and building things that feel
        intentional rather than rushed or performative. Whether I’m
        collaborating with a team, supporting a project, or building
        something of my own, the goal is always the same: do the work
        well, communicate clearly, and leave things better than I found
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m inspired by creativity, animals, and the
        quiet satisfaction of making something useful and meaningful.
